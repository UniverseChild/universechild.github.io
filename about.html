            <p>Welcome to <strong>What Words Leave Behind</strong>, a space dedicated to exploring the intersection of art, creativity, and human expression. This site was created as a passion project to share insights about visual arts, provide educational resources for students and fellow artists, and celebrate the transformative power of creative work.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--primary-teal); margin-top: 2rem;">Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Art has the unique ability to capture moments and evoke emotions that words sometimes cannot fully express. Through thoughtful blog posts, comprehensive lesson plans, and visual narratives, this site aims to inspire artists and creatives at all skill levels, provide practical teaching resources for art educators, explore art movements and techniques, and foster a community of art enthusiasts who value authentic creative expression.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--primary-teal); margin-top: 2rem;">What You'll Find Here</h3>
            <p><strong>Blog Posts:</strong> In-depth articles exploring everything from historical art movements like Surrealism and Pointillism to contemporary topics like AI in art and the intersection of art and science.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Student Lessons:</strong> Complete, ready-to-use lesson plans designed for middle school art classes. Each lesson includes step-by-step instructions, teaching tips, and creative project ideas that balance structure with imaginative freedom.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Visual Narratives:</strong> A collection of photographs and visual stories that complement the written content and showcase the beauty found in everyday moments.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--primary-teal); margin-top: 2rem;">A Note from the Creator</h3>
            <p>This website is maintained as a hobby and labor of love. While I may not be creating physical art as actively as I once did, I remain deeply passionate about supporting other artists, educators, and students on their creative journeys. Every resource shared here comes from years of experience in art education and a genuine desire to help others discover and develop their artistic voice.</p>

            <p>Whether you're a fellow artist looking for inspiration, a teacher seeking lesson plans, or simply someone who appreciates thoughtful reflections on art and culture, I hope you find something valuable here.</p>
